				<h3> 1 DECEMBER 2016 - 2 APRIL 2017
				</h3>
				</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 16px">Robert Rauschenberg blazed a new trail for art in the second half of the twentieth century. Moving between painting, sculpture, photography, print-making, installation and performance throughout his six-decade career, he refused to be straight-jacketed by rules and conventions.

				This major exhibition will explore each period of his varied career. Alongside his early experiments and first collaborations with fellow artists and friends John Cage, Merce Cunningham and Jasper Johns it will also showcase his work with Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T), an organisation which developed collaboration between artists and engineers in the 1960s.
				This exhibition is a chance to see some of Rauschenberg's most important works and explore how his passion for collaboration and innovation helped to blur the boundaries between the visual arts, performance dance and science.
